    <h2>position:absolute;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
        positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

    <div class="rel">
        This div element gas position: relative;
        <div class="absolute">
            This div element has position: absolute;

    <div class="absolute1">
        This div element has position: absolute;
    </div>
    <div class="sticky">I am sticky</div>
    <div>
        <p>In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll
            position.</p>
        <p>Scroll back up to remove the stickyness.</p>
